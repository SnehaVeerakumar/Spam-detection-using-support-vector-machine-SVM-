<h1 align="center"> Project Overview</h1>
<p >
<font size="3"> 

<b>Aim</b> of the project is to build a spam classifier that can categorise an e-mail as either “spam” or “ham” using Support Vector Machine.
<br>
<b>A dataset </b> consisting of 5728 e-mails has been pre-processed to get the frequencies i.e., number of occurences of each word. After pre-processing, words have been classified into spam and non spam using text mining packages. Top four kernels of SVM model has been tested for accuracy and the best kernel has been chosen for prediction. Once the text mining process is terminated, fit the SVM model with best kernel to predict whether an e-mail is spam or ham.
<br>
<b>Support Vector Machine </b> builds a classifier by searching for a separating hyperplane (optimal hyperplane) which is optimal and maximises the margin that separates the categories (in our case spam and ham). Thus, SVM has the advantage of robustness in general and effectiveness when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
